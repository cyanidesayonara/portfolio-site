A fork of the Aurora project by Pixelmatix, Borealis is a visualizer software for a 64x64 pixel LED matrix display. This enhanced version quadruples the original project's display size from 32x32 pixels and adds new features for the IR remote controlled screen, enabling it to display images, animations, date/time, and other visual content.

## Source Code

The project is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cyanidesayonara/borealis).
