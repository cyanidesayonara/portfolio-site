A fork of the Aurora project by Pixelmatix, Borealis is a visualizer software for a 64x64 pixel LED matrix display. This enhanced version quadruples the original project's display size from 32x32 pixels and adds new features for the IR remote controlled screen, enabling it to display images, animations, date/time, and other visual content.

## Features

- 64x64 LED matrix display (4x the original 32x32 design)
- IR remote control interface
- Multiple visualizations and patterns
- Clock display with date and time
- Custom image rendering
- Configurable animations and transitions
- Demo modes for showcasing capabilities

## Demo Videos

Below are demonstrations of the LED matrix in action. These GIFs showcase various visual patterns and effects running on the 64x64 LED matrix hardware.
