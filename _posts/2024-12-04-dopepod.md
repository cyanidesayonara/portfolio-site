# dopepod - Podcast Player Evolution

A podcast player project that has evolved from a web application to a cross-platform mobile app, providing an easy way to discover and enjoy thousands of free podcasts.

## Web Version (v1)

_The original web-based dopepod interface_

The original dopepod used Django with PostgreSQL for the backend, with jQuery powering the frontend. The iTunes API provided the podcast catalog, while custom scrapers enriched the podcast metadata.

## Mobile Version (v3)

_The new cross-platform mobile version (dop3pod)_

Version 3.0 represents a complete rebuild with Flutter and Django. The backend uses Django REST Framework with PostgreSQL, while Celery and Redis handle background tasks. Scrapy spiders keep the podcast directory fresh and up-to-date.

The app is [available on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyanidesayonara.dopepod), with an iOS version in development.

## Source Code

Both versions are open source and available on GitHub:
- [Web Version (v1)](https://github.com/cyanidesayonara/dopepod)
- [Mobile Version (v3)](https://github.com/cyanidesayonara/dop3pod)
