A Python GUI application developed for the Hospital District of Helsinki's engineering team. The program interfaces with an LXscan spot luminance meter to log display test results directly into Excel templates, significantly reducing the time needed for manual data entry.

## Source Code

The project is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cyanidesayonara/monitorimittari).
