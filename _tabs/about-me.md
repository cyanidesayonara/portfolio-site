I'm Santtu Nyk√§nen, a thirty-something full-stack developer from Helsinki, now based in Barcelona. My path to becoming a developer began in June 2017 with a simple decision to try an online programming course with a friend. After reading about the high demand for developers and driven by a natural competitive streak, I enrolled in Harvard's CS50x course.

What started with creating [a simple basketball game in Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/164378114/) turned into a passionate pursuit of programming knowledge. Even though the path to becoming employable seemed challenging, the joy of problem-solving and creating through code made every step worthwhile.

*My first programming project: a simple basketball game made with Scratch*

After nearly two years of self-study and dedicated learning, I landed my first coding position in spring 2019. Since then, I've worked as a consultant on various projects, primarily using Python, Java, and JavaScript. In my free time, I continue to explore new technologies, recently diving into mobile development with Flutter.
